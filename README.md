# ParallaxConfigurator
An in-game tool to quickly test changes for Parallax configs.
Allows dynamically changing shader parameters and textures, saving changes to a `.txt` file as well as loading them back.

**TODO:** Support toggling emission on/off. It can change emission color, but it can't enable or disable emission altogether. You'll therefore have to change the config and restart the game to toggle it.
